# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

- The purpose of this this challenge was to create a weather dashboard, or an application that allows you to search up any city so that you may see the current weather and five-day forecast for that city. The weather data presented is the temperature, wind speed, and humidity and as well as a weather icon that represents the most probable weather outcome for each day. This project was an interesting experience and I learned how convenient it is to use APIs to grab data.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
- The way to use this application is fairly straightforward. Type any city on the search form and and press the submit button to get the weather data for that city.
